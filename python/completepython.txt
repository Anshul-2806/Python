Python Download :
Step 1: Open this link - https://www.python.org/downloads/
Step 2: Choose the version you want to download. For convenience just click on download button and it will download the latest version. If you have some other OS then download Python for that OS which you have.


Now we will move on to download VS Code for better coding experience and then we will learn to install both of them.

VS Code Download :
To write Python code we need IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and for that we choose Visual Studio Code bcoz it is advanced and easiest to use and write code. 

Step 1: Open this link - https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Step 2: Download VS Code according to your OS which u have.


Now we will learn how to install them.

Installing Python :
Step 1: Click and open it.
Step 2: Tick on Add Python to PATH
Step 3: Click on install now.


Installing VS Code :
Keep everything to default and click on next everytime and install. Except click on tick on both "Add"



What you can do with Python :
You can create machine learning projects, websites, GUI Projects, scripts for scrapping, bots, etc. 

VS Code Overview :
Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor or IDE developed by Microsoft for all major OS’s. It have features like debugging, embedded Git control and GitHub, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. These features of VS Code make it the best IDE in today’s world.
There are alot of features in VS Code which make it one of most favorite code editor among coders. Features like:

Multiple terminals running at the same time.
Multiple files open at the same time which is awesome for web developers.
It’s have ability of customize, we can install various extensions in it.
We can install different python interpreters and change according to our need.
Multiple cursor points to edit or write repeating text.
There is a bar named “outline” in which all modules, classes, functions, variables and everything is listed in an organized way with their own logos making it very easy to differentiate and access.
It gives you an overview of your code in a minimized way.
These are just some of the many features of VS Code.

 
Checking Python Installation :
After installing Python and VS Code you must check that whether you have successfully installed Python or had some problem. So, check it using terminal.



First Python Program :
print("hello world")
 

So, here we wrote our first program in Python.

This Program allows us to print Hello World on the screen.

Programming Languages :
Programming Language are the languages which allows users to interact with computer and these languages comprises of set of instructions which produce various kinds of outputs.
Programming Languages are used to create programs which allow users to perform complex task in seconds.
Programming Languages are used because computer doesn’t understand human languages so we write code in programming language which later on get converted by language processors in machine language or binary code.

Python in Brief :
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Python use interpreter as its language processor.
Python is used to develop GUI Programs, Web Applications, websites, Games, scripts, etc. and python is even used in networking and all. Python is even used to do photo editing, video editing and other type of general purpose work.
This programming language is used mostly everywhere in tech field. It is used in Data Science, AI, Machine learning etc. 

Features of Python:
	Easy to Learn
	High Level PL
	OOPL
	Platform Independent
	Huge Library
	Interpreted PL

Applications of Python:
	Web Application- Django, Pyramid, Flask, Bottle
	Desktop Application- Tkinter
	Games & 3D Application
	Mobile Application
	Data Science
	ML- Scikit-learn and TensorFlow
	Data Anaysis- Matplotib, Scaborn
	Automation
	AI

Understanding First Code :
print("hello world\n")

In this code we wrote a function (print) which allows us to print anything which is written inside that function in double quotes (“”).

So, in print function when we use “” (Double Quotes) it means anything enclosed in double quotes will be displayed as it is and is known as string.

String is a data type in Python which is related to text. And to make string just enclose that part in either (‘’) Single or (“”) Double quotes.

Python in Power Shell :
We can write code in Power Shell of windows. But the problem is that it’s like interactive mode i.e. we can only write one line code at a time and then we have to execute it. So, this type of interactive mode is used when we want to check any error in any specific line or at the time of debugging the program.

So, we should write code in good IDE i.e. VS Code, Pycharm, Sublime, Notepad++,Jupiter, etc. Because it provide us many features and allows us to write good and efficient code.

VS Code Community :
VS Code is one of the best IDE in today’s world and it is developed and maintained by Microsoft on regular basis.

The main thing about VS Code is that it’s a IDE of Microsoft and as we all know Microsoft is such a big company and its services are generally marvelous and that’s why I also prefer using this VS Code. It is open source software which allows us to write code and there are many people who are managing it on daily basis and try to improve it regularly. 

 

Indentation in Python :
There are 3 types of statements in Python :-

Simple Statement
Empty Statement
Complex Statement
In Complex statements there are two portions, header and body.

if (5>4): 				#This is the header part
    print("5 is greater than 4") 	#This is body part
    print("Got it!")

else:  					#This is the header part
    print("Bye guys!")  		#This is body part

So, indentation means leaving a TAB space from margin and in python it is used to show that statements which are indented belong to upper statement.

In statements like if, if-else, elif, for etc. we use indentation because these all are type of complex statements and they have two parts as I already told you header and body.

We have to indent our body statements to show that these are sub-statements of our main statements which is written in header portion.

i = 0

while (i<10) : 	#This is a header part
    print(i+1) 	#This is a body part
    i++

Comments in Python :
Comments are the code which is not executed while interpreting the code. Comments are used to make the code more understandable for the programmer. 

There are two types of comments in Python :-

   Single Line Comment
and
   Multi-Line Comment

Single Line comment is the comments which are created in single line only.

These are created using # (Hash/Pound Symbol) in Python.

Multi Line comment are the comments which are created by using multiple lines i.e. they occupy more than one line in the program.

These are created using triple quote (''' Comment Code ''') in Python.

#It's a single line comment

print("Hello Everyone")

'''
It's a multi
line
comment
'''

print("Hope you understood about comments")


Modules and Import Statements:
Module – Module or library is the file which contain definitions of several functions, classes, variables, etc. which are written by someone else for free use.

Modules are used in code when we want to do some work and that work is already done by someone else and available in any module then we can simply import that module and can use that code in our program.

There are many modules in Python which can be downloaded from internet and can be used in our python program.

And there are some built-in modules also which are available to use when we are offline.

import math #Here we have imported a built-in module 'math'

print("Here we will use some math functions")
a = 2
b = 4
c = math.sqrt(16)
d = math.pow(a,b)
print(c)
print(d)

So, in above code as you can see we have downloaded a module named as opencv-python. So that’s how you can download module :

#pip install _module_name

And After downloading modules you have to simple import them or use them in your program.

So, to do so simply type:  import _module_name in your code.

That’s how you can use module in your programs.

Variables :
A variable is a name or an identifier which is given to any storage area or memory location.
It’s a name of memory location.
Rules for defining a variable in Python :-

	Variable name can contain alphabets, digits, and underscore (_).
	Variable name can start with an alphabet and underscore only.
	It can’t start with a digit.
	No whitespace and reserved keywords are allowed to use as a variable name.
	Variables are case-sensitive.
	E.g. a=5, _name = "Anshul", a1 = 30, etc.


Type-Casting :
Type-casting is defined as converting one data type into another for smooth functioning of a program.

With type() function we can find the type of any variable.
print("\t\tType Casting")

a = 52
b = 58.68
c = "anshul"

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))

Type-casting is done when we want to perform arithmetic operations on the variables of same data type.

print("\t\tType Casting\n")

a = 15
b = "25"
print(type(b))
b = int(b)
print(type(b) )
print("Sum of a and b is",a+b)


Strings :
String literal in python are enclosed in either single quotes (‘’) or double quotes (“”).

It means “hello” is same as ‘hello’.

We can simply assign string to a variable.

print("\t\t Strings")

a = "Hello"
print(a)

demo = '''
This is an
example of
multi-line
string.
'''
print((b))

So, here we declared a variable Demo and in that variable we assigned a multi-line string.

In multi-line strings also we can use either single quotation mark or double quotation mark.

String Slicing :
In Python to use any specific character of string we use index no.

Index no. is a special type of no. which allows us to extract any character from string.

Index no. starts from 0.

For example:

print("\t\t Strings")

a = "Hello"
print(a[0])
print(a[1])
print(a[2:5])
Copy
String Functions :
variable_name.strip() = This function allows us to remove all the blank spaces near to string.
print("\t\t Strings")

a = "   Hello  "
print(a)
print(a.strip())
Copy
len() = len function counts the total characters of any string.
print("\t\t Strings")

a = "Hello"
print(a)
print(len(a))
Copy
variable_name.lower() = This function converts all the characters in lower case of a string.
print("\t\t Strings")

a = "Hello"

print(a)
print("\n")
print(a.lower())
Copy
variable_name.upper() = This function converts all the characters in upper case of a string.
print("\t\t Strings")

a = "Hello"

print(a)
print("\n")
print(a.upper())
Copy
variable_name.replace(“char1”, ”char2”) = This function replaces char1 by char2 in a string.
print("\t\t Strings")

a = "Hello"
print(a)
print(a.replace('ello', 'i'))
Copy
Adding Strings :
We can simply add two or more strings by using ‘+’ operator between two variables.

print("\t\t Strings")

a = "Hello"
b = " Guys"
print(a+b)
Copy
Format Strings :
It means we can easily format string by using .format function.

print("\t\t Strings")

a = "Demo"
b = "Format"
print("This is the {} string".format(a,b))
print("This is the {0} string".format(a,b))
print("This is the {1} string".format(a,b))
Copy
In placeholders we can pass values such as 0,1 etc.

print("\t\t Strings")

a = "Demo"
b = "Format"
print(f"This is a {a} of {b} string")
Copy
Operators :
An Operator is a symbol which is used to perform operations on operands in any programming language.

In python there are many type of operators :

* - This is an exponential operator i.e. if we write 2*3 then it means 2 raise to power 3.
// ( Floor division ) – This divides two no. but returns a integer value.
% (Modulus Operator) – This operator returns the remainder.
There are many more operators such as +,-,*,/ etc.

Python Data Collections:
In Python there are some built-in or core data types :

Lists
Tuples
Sets
Dictionaries
Now we’ll discuss each of them in brief.

Lists :
A List in Python represents a list of comma-separated values of any data type between square brackets.

print("\t\tList\n")

lst = [8,5,2,9,7]

print(lst)
print(type(lst))

print(lst[0])
print(lst[1])
print(lst[2: 5])
Copy
List Functions :
variable_name(list).append – This function adds a new value or element in the end of the list.
lst = [8,5,2,9,7]

print(lst)
print(type(lst))

lst.append(99)      #append runction
print(lst)
Copy
variable_name(list).insert(index_no, value) – This function adds a new element at any index no. in the list.
lst = [8,5,2,9,7]

print(lst)
print(type(lst))

lst.insert(0,99)        #insert runction
print(lst)
Copy
variable(list).remove(element) – This function removes an element from the list.
lst = [8,5,2,9,7]

print(lst)
print(type(lst))

lst.remove(2)       #remove runction
print(lst)
Copy
variable(list).pop() – This function removes one element from the end of the list.
lst = [8,5,2,9,7]

print(lst)
print(type(lst))

lst.pop()       #remove one element from list
print(lst)
Copy
del variable[index_no] – This keywords allows us to remove or delete any particular element from the list by using it’s index no.
lst = [8,5,2,9,7]

print(lst)
print(type(lst))

del lst[2]       #remove the element at index 2
print(lst)
Copy
del variable(list) – This is used to delete whole list from the program.
Variable(list).clear – This function removes all the elements of the list.
lst = [8,5,2,9,7]

print(lst)
print(type(lst))

lst.clear()       #clears the list
print(lst)
Copy
Tuples:
These are those lists which cannot be changed i.e., are not modifiable. Tuples are represented as list of comma-separated values of any date type within parentheses.
Tuples doesn’t allow modification.

If we wish to modify any tuple then we’ll get error but we can modify type after converting or type casting it into the list.

print("\t\tTuples\n")

tup = ('Demo', 'Hello', 54, 'Guys')
print(tup)
print(type(tup))
tup = list(tup)
tup[1] = 99
print(tup)
Copy
Sets :
Sets in python are a data type equivalent to sets in mathematics. It may consist various elements and the order is undefined.

Sets elements are enclosed in {} Curly Braces.

In sets repeated elements does not get printed.

Sets Functions :
variable_name.add(element ) – This function is used to add one element in the Set.
print("\t\tSets\n")

set1 = {1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3}
print(set1)
print(type(set1))
set1.add(99)
print(set1)
Copy
variable_name.update([element1, 2, 3…]) – This function allows us to add many elements in the set.
print("\t\tSets\n")

set1 = {1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3}
print(set1)
print(type(set1))
set1.update([5,6,99,109,199])
print(set1)
Copy
There are many more functions of sets such as .pop, .clear, del etc. Try them in your computer.

Dictionary :
Dictionary data type is another feature in Python's hat. The dictionary is an unordered set of comma-separated key: value pairs, within {},with the requirement that within a dictionary, no two keys can be the same (i.e., there are unique keys within a dictionary).

print("\t\tDictionary\n")

dictionary1 = {
    "Play" : "Doing some activity",
    "Food" : "Something eatable",
    "Python" : "Language",
}

print(dictionary1)
print(len(dictionary1))
Copy
Dictionary Functions are same as of list, tuples etc. 

Conditional Statements :
These are complex statements which possess some conditions. It means in these statements control only enters when the condition is true.

In Python we can take input from user by using function:

input()
Copy
This function takes the input from user but it always take input in string data type i.e. if we want any arithmetic operation to be done on that input then we need to type cast that input into either int or float data type.

print("\t Input statement \n")

a = int(input("Enter any number: "))
name = int(input("Enter any name: "))
print(type(a))
print(a)
print(type(name))
print(name)
Copy
So, In conditional statements we have 3 type of statements :

if statement
if-else statement
elif statement
if statement – In if statement condition is checked and if the condition is true then body of if statement get executed.
print("\t Conditional Statements \n")

x = int(input("Enter any number: "))
if (x>100):
    print("Number entered is greater than 100")

print("END!")
Copy
if-else statement – In if-else statements condition is checked and if condition is true then block of if statement get executed but if ‘if’ condition is false then block of else statement get executed.
print("\t Conditional Statements \n")

age = int(input("Enter your age: ")

if (age>=18):
    print("You are eligible to vote")

else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote")
Copy
elif statement – In these type of statements, there are many instances when there is a need to check condition. We use these statements when we have to check many conditions.
print("\t Conditional Statements \n")

x = int(input("Enter any number: ")

if (x>50):
    print("Number is greater than 50")
elif (x>25):
    print("No. entered is b/w 25-50")
elif (x>0):
    print("Number entered is between 0-25")
else:
    print("Enter valid number")
Copy
Loops :
Loops or iterative statements are the statements which allow repetition of block of code again and again till the condition become false.

There are 2 type of loops in Python :

for Loop and while loop.
print("\t Loops \n")

num = 5
for a in range(1, 11 ):
    print(num, 'x ', a, '=', num* a)
Copy
print("\t Loops \n")

x = 1
while(x<=100):      #while loop
    print(x)
    x = x+1
Copy
In loops sometimes we use break and continues statements :

break statement is used to stop the loop before it has loops through all the items or statements.

continue statement allows us to stop the current or active iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration.

Functions :
A function is a block of codes that take inputs, do some specific task and produces output. We create functions when we have to do some work again and again in a program. That’s why we create function and calls it whenever we want to use it in our program.

Creating a function :
'''
def function_name () :

         statement 1,

         statement 2,

         ….
'''
Copy
print("\t Functions \n")

def demo():     #Derining a runction
    print("Hlo Guys")
    print("It's my First Function")
    print(" : )")

demo()      # Calling a runction
Copy
print("\t Functions \n")

def add(a,b):        #Derining Function
    c = a+b
    return c

x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
y = int(input("Enter a number: "))

z = add(x,y)        #Calling Function
print("The Sum is", z)
Copy
OOP (Object Oriented Programming) :
Python is an object oriented programming language.

So it have concept of class and objects.



Short Notes Summary:
Python Introduction [00:00 – 00:17]:  
Guido van Rossum created Python in December 1989, and it was released in 1991.
It is an open-source, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. 
It is used for developing desktop GUI, web and software development, etc.
Download Python [00:17 – 00:58]:
 Download latest version of Python from the given link: https://python.org/downloads/    
Download and Install VS code [00:58 – 01:35]:
For more efficient and faster coding, we are going to use the VS Code IDE. It is a free source editor developed by Microsoft that provides support for debugging, smart code finishing, syntax highlighting, etc.
You can easily download the VS Code from the given link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download.
After successfully downloading the VS Code, install it like any other software. 
What will you learn by the end of this video? [02:22 – 02:55]  
After completing this Python tutorial, you will acquire a firm grip on the basic as well as the advanced concepts of Python. This video will help you get the in-depth details of the logic building so that you can easily write advanced programs for machine learning, GUI creation, and website development. 
Overview Of VS Studio Code [02:55 – 04:37]  
First and foremost, it is an editor that is beyond your expectations! Because of its fascinating and useful features like debugging, smart-code completion, embedded Git control and GitHub, support for hundreds of languages, snippets, and more VS Studio is considered as the best IDE in today's world. With its lightning-fast source code editor, VS Studio Code comes out as the perfect IDE for daily use.
Verifying Python Installation [04:37 – 06:06] 
We are going to check whether the Python has installed successfully or not. We can check with the help of the terminal. 
Just type "Python" on the terminal, if the terminal returns the version of Python, then you are done with successfully installing Python. 
Python Basics [06:06 – 07:40]    
Writing Our First Python Program:
We are going to write our first "Hello World" program in Python.

Step 1: Write print("Hello world\n") on screen.

Step 2: Go to extensions and install "Code runner."

Step 3: Click on the run program button, and "Hello World" will be printed successfully on your screen.

You have successfully made your first Python program. Pat yourself on the back!

What Is A Programming Language?
⦁ It is a fact that we all need a language to establish efficient and easy communication with each other. Similarly, we need a language to develop a proper connection with computers. The language which helps us to communicate with computers is known as a programming language.

⦁ A programming language comprises a set of instructions that perform a specific task or function when executed.

⦁ Programming languages are used to develop algorithms so that the time-consuming tasks can be completed within seconds.

Understanding Our First Code:
The first code we wrote was a "Hello World" program. In this program, we used a print() function that helps us to print the message verbatim on the output screen.

Write your message within the double or single ("",' ')quotes, and it will be displayed on the output screen.

Example:

print(" Code With Harry")

Output: Code With Harry

Using Python REPL in Terminal [12:10 – 14:03]           
Python in Power Shell:
   Python programs can be written in Windows Powershell. But, the problem with Windows Powershell is that it allows us to write only one line of code at a time. After one line, it automatically executes the code. Therefore, it becomes difficult to build large programs or script. Therefore, we need an IDE or editor so that we can quickly write, debug, and run our program in a single software.

Community Of Visual Studio Code:
⦁ Because of its vibrant and fast-growing community, VS Code turns out to be the best IDE in the world. The best thing about VS Code is that it is developed by Microsft, and we all know that we can trust this tech-giant. Thousands of people are working on the development of this IDE, and it is getting better day by day. 

⦁ It is an open-source project; therefore, you can also contribute to their community on Github.

Indentation [15:20 – 18:03]  
Indention In Python: 
⦁ In other programming languages, indentation refers to spaces with respect to the margin. But, in Python, it is much more than simple spaces. Other programming languages use indentation for better readability of code, but Python used indentation as a block of code.

⦁ Python indentation tells the interpreter that a group of statements is related to a specific block or cell of code.

Comments [18:03 – 21:35] 
Comments In Python:
⦁ Comments in Python or any other programming language are just for a better understanding and better readability of code. Whenever an interpreter encounters a comment in the program, it simply skips it and moves to the next line of code. 

⦁ Developers make use of comments because, without comments, things can get really confusing. It would be impossible to know the function of code in a massive program. 

⦁ Comments help the developers to explain the logic used in a line of code. 

Types Of Comments In Python:
⦁ Single line comments

⦁ Multi-line comments

Single line comments: To make a single line comment, simply start your line with a # symbol. The single-line comments are automatically terminated at the end of the line.
Multi-line comments: To make a multi-line comment, simply start your line with the" "" symbol. Unlike single line comments, they do not get terminated automatically. We need to add the closing symbol, i.e.""" for their termination.
There is no pre-defined syntax for adding comments. You can do whatever feels more comfortable for you.

Modules and import statement [21:35 – 27:52]
What Are Modules In Python?
Modules in Python are Python files which contain some pre-written code(functions, classes, variables, etc.). Modules are free to use, and we can use them by using an import statement.

Why Are Modules Needed?
Modules are used when we need a piece of code that is already written by someone and available on the internet.

Suppose we are making a game in which one module is responsible for the game logic, and another module would be accountable for user login. Here, each module is a different file with the .py extension, and we can easily import them into our program.

Syntax For Downloading A Module:
There are plenty of Python modules that are available on the internet. In Python, we also have some in-built modules that can be used offline. 

Step 1: Before importing the module into our program, we need to download it first. 

You can download any module using the syntax below:

 # pip install _module_name 
Copy
Step 2: After successfully downloading the required module, we can easily import it into our program. 

Follow the syntax given below to import any module:

# import _module_name
Copy
Variables [27:52 – 39:32]
Variables In Python:
 A Python variable is a reserved memory location in which values are stored. 
In other words, data is given to the computer for processing, with the help of a variable.
Python has no command to declare a variable in contrast to other programming languages.
Rules For Variable Declaration:
The name of the variable may include alphabets, digits, and underscore ( ).
We can use the alphabet and underscore only for the starting of a variable name.
A variable name can not begin with a digit.
Variable names are case-sensitive.
Whitespaces and reserved keywords can not be used as a variable name.
TypeCasting [39:32 – 44:17]
Type-Casting In Python:
The conversion of one data type into another data type is known as Type-casting.
Python is an object-oriented programming language, and there may be situations when we want to perform arithmetic operations on the variables of the same data type. Here, type-casting comes into the picture.
With the help of type() function, we can easily find out the data type of any variable.
Strings [44:17 – 58:24]
Strings In Python:
In a similar way to other popular programming languages, Python strings are byte arrays representing Unicode characters.
Like other programming languages, Python does not support a char(character) data type.
A single character is considered as a string of 1 length.
How To Create Strings In Python?
Creating strings in Python is like assigning a value to a value. We just need to enclose the characters in single or double-quotes.

Example: 

a= " Code With Harry "

b= ' Code With Harry '

String Slicing In Python:
In Python, slicing is a feature that allows us to access a specific part of a string.
In order to extract any character from a string, we use index numbers. 
Index number start from 0. 
Example: a= "Code With Harry"

Here, a[0]= C

similarly, a[1]= o

String Functions:
There are plenty of string functions available in Python. I am listing some of the most commonly used string functions.

len(): This function returns the length of a string.
variable_name.lower(): This function returns the lowercased string from the given string.
variable_name.upper(): This function returns the uppercased string from the given string.
variable_name.replace("Char1"," char2"): This function is used to replace one character by another character. Here, char1 gets replaced by char2 in a given string.
isalpha(): This function returns boolean value(True or False). Returns true if strings are in the alphabet and vice-versa.
isdigit(): This function also returns boolean value. Returns true if all characters of a given string are digits and vice-versa.
Operators [58:24 – 59:50]
Operators In Python:
 An operator is a symbol that tells a compiler or interpreter to perform a specific task. 

The value on which operators operates is known as an operand.

Examples: 

a=5

b=7

c= a+b

Here '+' is the operator and operands are 'a' and 'b'.

Types Of Operators In Python:
There are plenty of operators in Python. Some of the most commonly used operators are given below:

+ - Addition operator
- Subtraction operator
* - Multiplication operator
/ - Divison operator
% - Modulus operator
** - Exponentiation operator
// - Floor Division
Core Data Types In Python:
There are four core data types in Python:

Lists
Tuples
Sets
Dictionaries
Lists [59:50 – 1:09:43]        
Lists In Python:
Written with square brackets.
They are mutable, i.e., changeable.
It is an ordered sequence of elements.
Repetition of elements is allowed.
List Functions:
variable_name(list).append :
 This function adds an element at the end of the list. 
Only a single element can be added at a time by using the append method.
variable(list).remove(element) – This function removes the a single element from the list.
variable_name(list).insert(index_no, value) - This function adds an element at a specified index.
Variable(list).clear - This function removes all the elements from a list.
list1.extend(iterable)-This function adds the element of a list at the end of a given list
copy()- This function copies one list into another list.
Tuples [1:09:43 – 1:13:05]
Tuples:
Written in parenthesis.
Tuples are immutable, i.e., they can be changed.
Tuples are also ordered sequence of elements.
Repetition of the element,i.e., duplicates, are not allowed.
Sets [1:13:05 – 1:17:15]           
Sets:
Written within curly brackets {}.
Sets are unordered and unindexed.
Duplicates are not allowed.
Sets Functions:
variable_name.add(element ) : This function allows us to add an element to a given set.
variable_name.update([element1, 2, 3…]): This function allows us to add more than one element to a given set.
variable_name.copy(element): This function returns the copy of a element.
There are plenty of functions of sets. Try to explore them by yourself.

Dictionary [1:17:15 – 1:21:30]
Dictionary:
Written within curly braces{}.
Dictionaries are unordered set.
Dictionaries have a key: value pairs within curly braces.
Within a dictionary, each and every key is unique.
Conditionals in Python [1:21:30 – 1:27:01]
Conditional Statements In Python:
In any programming language, conditional statements are the statements or expressions which perform various calculations depending on whether a specific boolean condition returns true or false.

Types Of Conditional Statements:
 There are three types of conditional statements:

if statement
if-else statement
elif statement
Now, we will discuss each of them in brief.

if statement: 
Syntax:

             if test condition:

                 statement(s)

 

Here, the interpreter evaluates the test condition, if the test condition returns true, then only the statement(s) block gets executed; otherwise, the program is terminated.

2.if-else statement: 
        Syntax:

                     if test expression:

                      statment 1

                 else:

                     statement 2

Here, the interpreter first checks the if test expression, if it turns out to be true, then statement 1 gets executed else the statement 2 gets executed.

3.elif statement: 
      Syntax: 

              if test expression:

               statement 1

    elif test expression:

     statement 2

    else: 

      statement 3

elif is the short form of else if.
Here, the interpreter first checks the if test expression, if it turns out to be false, then the next elif block gets tested and so on.
Loops [1:27:01 – 1:33:42]    
Loops In Python:
In Python or any other programming language, loops come into the picture when we need to iterate over a sequence.
Loops allow us to repeat a specific block of code again and again until a condition turns out to be false.
Types Of Loops In Python:
There are two types of loops in Python:

For loop
While loop
For Loop: 
For loops are used to iterate over a sequence of a given list, tuples, sting etc.
range() function is used to iterate over a series of item.
While Loop:
While loops allows us to execute a set of code or statement as long as a given condition is true.
Once the given statement turns out to be false, while loops terminates.
Break And Continue In Python:
Break and continue statements are used when we want to alter the flow of the normal loop.
Python Break Statement: 
The break statement terminates the current loop (loop containing the break statement)
The control flows to the body of the program after the loop, and the execution of the next statement takes place.
Python Continue Statement:
It returns the control at the beginning of the while loop.
The continue statement skips all of the statements in the current iterating loops and returns the control at the top of the loop.
Loop does not get terminated, but it continues with the next iteration.
Functions [1:33:42 – 1:38:37]     
Functions In Python:
Organized and reusable code.
They are used for performing single or related actions.
Advantages Of Functions:
Better application modularity
High degree of code reusability
Better code clarity
Less degree of code duplication
Why Do We Need Functions?
 Suppose you are writing a program in which you want to use a piece of code again and again. Will you write that code again and again? Isn't it time-consuming?
To solve this problem, we use functions. Instead of writing code, again and again, we simply make a function and call the function whenever we need it.
Rules For Function Declaration:
It must begin with keyword def, followed by the name of the function and parenthesis.
Input parameters or arguments must be placed in the parenthesis.
A colon(:) marks the end of the function header.
A return statement is used to return something from a function, but it is optional.
Syntax For Function Declaration:
'''def function_name( parameters ) :

         statement 1

         statement 2'''

OOPs Concepts in Python [1:38:37 – 1:42:40]     
Object-Oriented Programming In Python
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It has support for various approaches to problem-solving.
OOP is one of the most popular and widely used approaches for problem-solving. In this approach, everything is treated as an object.
The concept of OOP is mainly based on DRY, which means Do not repeat yourself.
The main purpose of OOP is creating reusable code.
OOP is associated with various concepts such as class, object, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance etc.
